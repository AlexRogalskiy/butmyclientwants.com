Pull Requests are definitely welcome, however, if you just want to add a resource, [open an issue with the link, title and description of the resource](https://github.com/brob/butmyclientwants.com/issues).

The site itself currently is static HTML and CSS, but there are plans to expand that in the future.

## Future Development

In the future, the site utilize a static site generator and probably move all the resources to a data file and use a static site CMS to edit.
